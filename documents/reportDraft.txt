Introduction:
Initial study of Cassandra vs MongoDB vs Neo4J
This was very different from other projects where we did not have specified goal (given some requirements and expected outcome),
so we had to first brainstorm about what are possible ways to do analysis, do machine learning. We also had to study GitHub api
 and see what is the different information we were able to collect. Thanks to Cody for suggesting GitHub. Had he not mentioned about this
 we would have spent hours of research on finding useful information from BlackDuck (as we did in HW3)
dificult to get data for all users for all repo
we decided to go for users only of java proejcts sicne they were substantial in number

Progress:
List of analysis, todos from ideas.txt and mention how much did we accomplish, mention that this is very
interesting topic and further research can be continued
