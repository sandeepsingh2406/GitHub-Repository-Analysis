** Analysis, pattern finding

Doable immediately, 1st round:
6] Graph of number of projects per language in the given year/month: done. Call getCollectionCount
10] cluster users according to numebr of users and show count of each cluster (number of users having number of repos in that range), show pie chart
11] subscribers count from repo json (not in all repos)
- cluster of number of repos per user

Doable after some more programming, data retrieval
1] Average bytes of code per languages/project
- number of commits from jgit
- number of files from jgit


2] number of days required (pushed at - created in repo json) during commits, average loc per day/per commit
3] number of files in a project, average number of different languages used in a project
4] different licenses for projects, which are very popular licensing schemes
5] average duration of project, average contributions per month
7] average number of contributors, per project
8] highly rated/reviewed projects (calculate popularity using subscribers, forks and watchers count)
9] graph of total number of languages used in all the projects (language on x axis, and number of files in that language on y-axis)


** Advanced machine learning / data mining tasks
10] find all followers of a given users, find followers' followers and build some ranking system using HITS or page ranking
11] give recommendation to show similar repositories based on subscription

Give us users

What were the hot new projects today?
○ In Ruby land...
○ In JavaScript land...
○ Globally?
● Did anyone commit something interesting or
controversial?
● For the people I follow, which projects did
they follow or contribute to?
● What are the emerging projects, or
languages?
